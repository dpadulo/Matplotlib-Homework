Welcome to Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. Pymaceuticals is currently in the testing phase for Capomulin, a new drug.

This project engages with the data from their most recent study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. This analysis includes a top-level summary of the study results in the form of a Jupyter notebook.
